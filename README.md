# Cipher-System-using-Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange
Designed a cipher system by making use of Substitution Cipher and the key generated by making a variation to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange(DHE) method.  You will also find the implementations of both the traditional DHE and modified DHE in the cipher system.
